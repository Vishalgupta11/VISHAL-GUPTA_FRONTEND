->The List component is a React component that displays a list of items as an unordered list. Each item in the list can be selected by clicking on it. When an item is 
  selected, its background color changes to green, and when it is deselected, it changes back to red.

# There are a few problems/warnings with the code:

1. The prop type for the items prop in the WrappedListComponent is incorrect. Instead of PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })), 
   it should be PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })).

2. The setSelectedIndex function in the WrappedListComponent is incorrectly defined. It should be const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null);.

3. The isSelected prop in the WrappedSingleListItem is not being used correctly. It should be isSelected === index instead of isSelected.

4. The onClickHandler prop in the WrappedSingleListItem is not being used correctly. It should be () => onClickHandler(index) instead of onClickHandler(index).
